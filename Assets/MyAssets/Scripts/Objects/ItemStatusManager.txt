	--state0,state1, state2--> these arrays stores the transitions from each status to the next one. They are the 
	  'arrows' on the diagram.
	
	  The format for each array item (remember, "array item" is "arrow in the diagram") is:
	      "Key Icon,1,KeyAtLock,1,KeyIcon,0"
	      
	      where
	        --Key Icon is the icon type needed to go forward in the diagram (e.g. the key icon to open a lock)
	        --1 is the target status in the current object.
	        --KeyAtLock and KeyIcon are auxiliary objects which will also change their status.
	        --1 and 0 are the auxiliary objects next status.
